I am a 2nd year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT), conducting research under [Prof. Richard Zanibbi](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~rlaz/)
at the [Document and Pattern Recognition Lab (DPRL), RIT](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/index.html).
Currently, I am involved in the [MathSeer project](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/mathseer/),
which is a system to make finding mathematical information easier by creating innovative search
engines, interfaces, and algorithms for extracting and recognizing visual
structure like mathematical formulas and chemical diagrams in documents.

**Research Interests**: Pattern recognition, computer vision, detection and recognition of graphical structures, deep
learning, natural language processing

## News

- (09/2021): Gave a poster presentation talk on the 
    MathSeer extraction pipeline at [ICDAR 2021](https://icdar2021.org/).
 
- (09/2021): MathSeer extraction pipeline released. This tool extracts formula
  locations and content in PDF documents. The pipeline is available from
  [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dprl/MathSeer-extraction-pipeline), and includes 
  improved versions of SymbolScraper, ScanSSD (now,
  ScanSSD-XYc), and QD-GGA. The pipeline was prepared by **Ayush K. Shah**,
  Abhisek Dey, Matt Langsenkamp, and Prof. Zanibbi.

- (04/2021): Our paper on the MathSeer formula
    extraction and evaluation pipeline accepted for publication at
    ICDAR 2021.

- (05/2021): Successfully defended and passed my Ph.D. Research Potential Assessment (RPA).

- (08/2020): Joined Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for Ph.D. in Computing and Information Sciences.

### Machine Learning Engineer

Fusemachines Nepal, <br> 
Aarya Tower Bhawan, Hattisar, Nepal

- Worked on the ML pipeline: data cleaning and pre-processing, model building, tuning hyperparameters, model
training, and model evaluation in NLP and Computer Vision domain.

- Developed a product classifier using chemical attributes to optimize business decisions for products that go unsold
using boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM.

- Built an intelligent character recognition system using CNN and RNN to predict handwritten texts (both English
and Nepali) in manually-filled form fields with an accuracy of 95%. 

- Analysed data provided by a subscription-based e-commerce client for building a recommendation system, which
led to an increase in revenue through cross-selling by 6% (large as we were serving 600k users).

- Designed, reviewed, and refined reading materials, quizzes, assignments, and projects for Fusemachines AI Education Programs - “Foundations in AI: Mathematics for AI” (linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics,
etc.), “Micro Degree™ in Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning, Computer Vision” (regresssion, image processing, feature detection, image classification, object recognition, etc.)
